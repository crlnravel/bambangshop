## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

> In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

In the case of BambangShop, we do not need an interface or trait for the Subscriber because there is only a single observer involved, which is the Subscriber itself. Typically, an interface or trait is useful when we plan to have multiple types of observers, allowing them to be managed in separate classes. However, in this case, a single Model struct is sufficient to handle our requirements.

That being said, from a best practice perspective, defining the Subscriber as an interface can provide more flexibility in the future, ensuring better scalability and adherence to SOLID principles. By using an interface, we can easily add new subscribers without modifying existing code, making the system more maintainable and reducing dependencies.

> id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

In this case, using DashMap is necessary and more efficient than Vec for storing Subscriber data with unique IDs and URLs because DashMap provides better performance. If we use Vec, each lookup operation would have a time complexity of O(n), whereas DashMap allows lookups with O(1) complexity. This means that lookup time remains constant regardless of the number of Subscribers. As a result, DashMap not only speeds up the search process but also makes managing Subscriber data more effective and scalable, making it the better choice in this case.

> When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

In this case, while the Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of an object exists, it is not sufficient to handle safe concurrent access in a multithreading context. The Singleton pattern can guarantee that only one instance of the HashMap is used, but it does not ensure safe access by multiple threads simultaneously, which could lead to race conditions.

Therefore, using DashMap is essential because it supports concurrent access, ensuring that multiple threads can safely read and write data. In this case, DashMap and the Singleton pattern complement each otherâ€”Singleton ensures that only one instance exists, while DashMap guarantees thread-safe concurrency. Thus, they are not mutually exclusive but rather work together to achieve both uniqueness and safe access.
